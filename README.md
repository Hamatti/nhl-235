# nhl-235

NHL results on your command-line with a familiar feel.

For decades, number 235 has been an important part of the morning routine of Finnish hockey fans. YLE's (Finnish Broadcasting Company) teletext page 235 displays on-going or latest results for NHL games. Its cultural importance is so big that I wanted to pay homage to it with this project.

## Status of the project

I consider 235 as pretty much feature-complete at this point. I'll fix bugs if I run into them and at some point I'll take a look at learning how to build it for other platforms than just Mac. Other than that, the project is not dead or abandoned even though it won't receive updates â€“ it's just, you know, working.

## Install

### Cargo

You can either install via [Rust's Cargo](https://crates.io):

```
cargo install nhl-235
```

I recommend adding a symlink to have a traditional `235` feeling:

```
ln -s ~/.cargo/bin/nhl-235 /usr/local/bin/235
```

If you're storing your cargo packages in a different folder, replace `~/.cargo/bin/nhl-235` with your folder path.

### Download binaries

or [download the latest binaries from GitHub](https://github.com/Hamatti/nhl-235/releases/latest).

Store the file with filename `235` in a folder that is in the path.

## Usage

### Basic usage

```
235
```

### Highlight favorite players

235 (from `1.2.0` onwards) supports configurable highlights of individual players.

To do this, you first need to create a config file to your home directory called `.235.config` and then call the script with

```
235 --highlight
```

### Current version

```
235 --version
```
